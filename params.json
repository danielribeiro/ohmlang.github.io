  "body": "### About Ohm\r\n\r\nOhm is a library and domain-specific language for parsing and pattern matching. You can use it to parse custom file formats, transform complex data structures, and quickly build parsers, interpreters, and compilers for programming languages. The Ohm language is based on parsing expression grammars (PEGs), which are a formal way of describing syntax, similar to regular expressions and context-free grammars. The Ohm library provides a JavaScript interface (known as Ohm/JS) for creating parsers, interpreters, and more from the grammars you write.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\n* [Language Hacking in a Live Programming Environment](http://tinlizzie.org/~awarth/live2016/) (to be presented at [LIVE'16](http://2016.ecoop.org/track/LIVE-2016))",
