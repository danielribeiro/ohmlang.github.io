  "body": "### About\r\n\r\nOhm is a parser generator consisting of a library and a domain-specific language.\r\nYou can use it to parse custom file formats or quickly build parsers, interpreters, and compilers for programming languages. The _Ohm language_ is based on [parsing expression grammars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)\r\n(PEGs), which are a formal way of describing syntax, similar to regular expressions and context-free\r\ngrammars. The _Ohm library_ provides a JavaScript interface (known as Ohm/JS) for creating parsers,\r\ninterpreters, and more from the grammars you write.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\n* Try out Ohm in the [online editor](https://ohmlang.github.io/visualizer/)\r\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/cdglabs/ohm/blob/master/doc/index.md)\r\n* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cdglabs/ohm)\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\n* [Language Hacking in a Live Programming Environment](http://tinlizzie.org/~awarth/live2016/) (to be presented at [LIVE'16](http://2016.ecoop.org/track/LIVE-2016))",
